# Privacy Policy

Last updated: February 27, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how PinIt Pro ("we", "us", "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use this project.

This project is currently provided at: [https://github.com/phani17c/az-to-pin](https://github.com/phani17c/az-to-pin).

## Scope

This policy applies to the PinIt Pro web app and backend services in this repository.

## Information We Collect

We collect only the information needed to run the app features you request.

### Information you provide

- Amazon product URLs you submit
- Pinterest access token you provide to connect Pinterest APIs
- Pinterest board selection and publish time you choose
- Affiliate tag values you enter
- Pin content and design inputs generated in your workflow
- Messages you send us (for example via GitHub issues)

### Automatically collected information

- Basic technical and usage data such as IP address, browser type, device type, request timestamps, and error logs

## How We Use Information

We use information to:

- Fetch product details from the URL you submit
- Generate and format pin content and pin design output
- Send user-initiated publish requests to Pinterest APIs
- Create and track affiliate links in the app workflow
- Operate, debug, secure, and improve the service
- Comply with legal obligations

## Pinterest and Other Third-Party Services

When you provide a Pinterest access token, we use it only to make Pinterest API requests you initiate (for example, loading boards or publishing a pin).

Depending on your configuration, data may also be processed by third-party providers used by the app (for example AI model providers, infrastructure/logging providers, and Pinterest itself).

We do not sell personal information.

## Data Sharing

We share data only in these situations:

- With service providers that process data on our behalf to operate the app
- With Pinterest when you request Pinterest API actions
- If required by law or valid legal process
- As part of a business transfer (for example merger or acquisition)

## Data Retention

We retain data only as long as necessary for the purposes above.

Current app behavior may include in-memory storage for some workflow records. In-memory records are generally cleared when the backend process restarts. Operational logs may be retained longer by hosting or logging systems.

## Security

We use reasonable technical and organizational safeguards to protect data. No online system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Children

This service is not directed to children under 16, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16.

## Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights to request access, correction, deletion, or restriction of your personal information. You may also object to certain processing where applicable.

To make a request, contact us using the information below.

## International Transfers

If data is processed outside your jurisdiction, we take reasonable steps to protect it under applicable law.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates are effective when posted on this page with a new "Last updated" date.
